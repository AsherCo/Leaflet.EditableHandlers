#EditableHandlers

This is a project which will include different tools to edit/play with geometries in Leaflet.
Currenlty I only added support for Circle edition.
That is, the user can move the circle as well as increase the radius of the circle by just using the drag areas.

CircleEditor extends from L.Circle and adds the handlers in order to move and increase the area.
To use it is the same way as initializing a Circle, with the difference that you will just call CircleEditor.

For example like this:

var eCircle = new L.CircleEditor(locationLatLng, 500 /*radius in meters*/, circleOptions);
map.addLayer(eCircle);
